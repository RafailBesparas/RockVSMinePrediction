# RockVSMinePrediction

The project's purpose is to illustrate how sonar works. Based on machine learning models and algorithms I try to find whether the object is a Rock or a Mine.
Also, there will be a Model Accuracy testing based on a dataset that the model has not seen yet. The dataset was created by a script found in StackOverflow of 
Gaussian noise.

# During this project I will try to use different algorithms for this task and evaluate their behaviour.
1. LinearRegression
2. K-Nearest Neighbors
3. Decision Trees
4. Support Vector Machine

# This project falls under the category of Binary classification.

Of course, there will be some mistakes as I am a junior data scienting - machine learning engineer but the point of this whole project is for me to learn more 
about machine learning. Explore more the Stackoverflow and other repositories, make myself more prone to error handling and last but not least get used to research
algorithms and ways to get better.
